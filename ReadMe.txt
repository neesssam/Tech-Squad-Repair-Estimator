This program allows a user to select a device type (PC or smartphone) and an issue with that device, and then calculates and displays the repair estimate based on the user's selections.

The program starts by displaying a welcome message and an outer menu loop that allows the user to select a device type or exit the program. If the user selects PC or smartphone, the program displays a list of repair options for that device type. The user can then select an issue or exit the program.

The program includes input validation to ensure that the user's choices are valid (i.e., within the range of available options). If the user selects option 3 at any point, the program exits the outer menu loop and terminates.

The repair estimate is calculated based on the user's selections using nested if statements. The estimate is displayed at the end of the program.

Overall, the program is a simple implementation of a menu-driven system for estimating repair costs for different devices and issues.
